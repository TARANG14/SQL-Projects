To solve the problem, I used complex SQL queries and applied several key SQL concepts such as joins, group by, aggregate functions, window functions, and subqueries to get the desired results.

The queries involved analyzing data from multiple tables and using advanced SQL functions to draw meaningful insights. Overall, this project required a strong understanding of SQL and the ability to apply complex queries effectively in a real-world scenario.
