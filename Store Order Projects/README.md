In this project, I worked with Super Store Order Analysis data to solve the problem using complex SQL queries. I used various SQL concepts such as joins, group by, aggregate functions, window functions, and subqueries to get the needed results.

The queries involved analyzing data from different tables and using advanced SQL functions to gain useful insights. Overall, the project required a good understanding of SQL and the ability to apply complex queries to real-world business problems.
